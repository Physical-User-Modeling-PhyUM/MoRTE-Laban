# MoRTE-Laban


In work developement of a framework for Motion Representation Translation and Exchange using Labannotation and Laban Movement Analysis. 

Currently supports automatic annotation of Kinect, Mediapipe and Amass data into whole body Labannotation, including legs, jumps, steps, and kicks. 

Requirements are those of Amass, LabanEditor, and Mediapipe. Tested on Python 3.8. To clone the repo, use git clone --recurse-submodules .

For using the modified laban with amass data, run the modified run_main.bat in MoRTE-Laban/LabanotationSuite/GestureAuthoringTools/LabanEditor.
